## Summary
In my analysis, there does not seem to be a positivity bias for Vine reviews. The percentage of Vine reviews with a 5-star rating is 38.24%, which is not overwhelmingly positive. I think paying for Vine reviews could be helpful in getting some positive reviews, but is not necessary to getting a lot of 5-star reviews. Additionally, it seems that the non-Vine reviews were more positive than the Vine reviews, which means that a positivity bias is unlikely. An additional analysis that could be performed is to analyze the 1-star reviews for negativity bias. Another problem could be that if the Vine reviews have a lower percentage of 1-star reveiws compared to the non-Vine reviews, it is likely that Vine reviews are biased towards not leaving a negative review.
